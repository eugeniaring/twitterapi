Social networks are constantly part of our life nowadays. Their popularity can be explained by accessibility and convenience, which allow users to provide huge amounts of information with limited or no restrictions on content. This continuous and rich mass of data is made available by these platforms with the purpose of studying sentiments about brands, products, events, recent news, social and political issues.

In this covid-19 period, there has been a dramatic growth on these platforms. In Twitter, there has been an increased use of the platform for misinformation related to the pandemic. For this reason, I am going to collect tweets from the last seven days that mention Corona Virus and Giuseppe Conte, that is the Prime Minister in Italy. My objective is to explain step by step how to extract data using Twitter API.
